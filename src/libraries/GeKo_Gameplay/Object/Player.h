The Player class is a Basic class to provide a playable character. It is just an Basic-Class and every "real" character-class has to be a generalisation of this class.
It provides a spawnpoint location, a  name, a current, a speed and can be visualized by a Geometry. The Geometry has to be bound to a Node (see Scenegraph for details!).
